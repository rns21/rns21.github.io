# **RDK Source and Releases**

<span style="color: rgb(55,65,81);">The RDK source code is distributed
across multiple repositories, which are available in the RDKCentral
Gerrit or in GitHub. For most of the repositories, ‘rdk-next’ is the tip
of the development branch, though some specific repositories use a
development branch with a name corresponding to the month/quarter. For a
stable version of the source code, please use a release branch (see the
Releases area below )</span>

<span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">RDK Broadband and Camera profiles
follow a quarterly release schedule. Beginning in 2023, RDK Video will
follow a yearly release schedule. The Release notes and instructions for
a reference platform are available on the respective release
page.</span>
